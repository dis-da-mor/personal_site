    <h1 class="title-heading">Music</h1><p class="main-paragraph">I started learning the electric guitar around 2 years ago, and have been producing music since then too. I can&#39;t think of a genre for what I make, so I slap it with the &quot;electronic&quot; tag and call it a day. Genres are a lie.

    You can find my music on my <a class="text-link" href="https://disdamoe.bandcamp.com/music">Bandcamp,</a> <a class="text-link" href="https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dis-da-moe/1641229235">Apple Music</a> or <a class="text-link" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3vsDqpqBxndJ1rePyWFApF">Spotify</a> and I've also listed some of it here alongside some info. It's all free, but you can pay however much you want.

                <b>What music do you like?</b>
                <br /><br />
                My inspiration comes mainly from video game soundtracks, my favourites being those from Celeste (Lena Raine), Undertale/Deltarune (Toby Fox), Minecraft (C418), Outer Wilds (Andrew Prahlow) and Hollow Knight (Cristopher Larkin). Other artists I like include Jack Stauber, Pink Floyd, Gorillaz, King Crimson and others.

                <b>What do you use to make music?</b>
                <br /><br />
                I currently use Logic Pro as my DAW, and I have a Player Fender guitar with a Boss Katana amp that I play. I use a lot of plug-ins from Valhalla, and instruments from Spitfire Audio. Most importantly, I use the feedback that I get from other people, including my music teacher and friends and family that are unlucky enough to be pestered that day. If you have any comment on my music, feel free to share it with me.

        <h1>Pretty Funky by Yo.Yo.Co.</h1><p>Yo.Yo.Co. is a band that I created in my school, and it is passed down from year to year with the hope of making some nice music. This is the first track ever created from it, completely from scratch. <a href="https://share.amuse.io/track/dis_da_moe-pretty-funky-yoyoco">It's released on some major platforms</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/7S7wHGJwPCQ">has a lyric video I made as well.</a></p>

        <h1>A Null Reference</h1><p>This track was inspired by a game jam where I got to work with a bunch of talented people to make a <a class="text-link" href="spacec.itch.io/cosmic-corp-llc">pretty cool game</a>. I used sound effects made by the <a class="text-link" href="https://linktr.ee/janseidel">audio guy</a> in the team, and I sort of wanted to make this feel like the constant trial and error that comes with programming. <strong>Null Reference </strong>is an exception in C# which means that you&#39;re trying to get something that isn&#39;t there, and is extremely common. </p>

        <h1>Erosion</h1>
        <p><strong>Abrasion</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Attrition </strong>were tracks that I made for a collab project that fell apart, but I was quite happy with them so I made another track to go along with them. <strong>Hydraulic Action </strong>features sounds of waves that I recorded, as well as the voices of my family when we were at the beach.</p>
