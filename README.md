# personal_site

https://disdamor.me

my personal website for showing what interests me.

## Running

- install nushell, rust, npm, and python
- run what you'd like from `commands_specific/`

you can find ignored files in each `.gitignore`. I have listed the ignored files for the `astro/public/large` directory and you can download those from the website;

## TODO

- animals (have pets?)
- graph editor
